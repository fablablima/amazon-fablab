amazon-fablab
=============

The initiative is to create a digital fabrication laboratory (Fab Lab) that will navigate the Amazon River. It will provide local communities with access to technological tools that allow them to cope with their daily challenges with water, energy, health, food, education while at the same time, serve as a place for research and development to better understand the Amazon. Because it is a green lung of the world, the Amazon is the ideal scene for exploring alternative solutions in favor of a responsible industry which is sensible and integrated to local and global developments.
